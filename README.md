# Mouse Trap Game

A very simple game in which you have to trap the mouse. The mouse is the green circle
and the way you trap it is you surround all 6 sides of the mouse with walls. 
If the mouse reaches the edge of the board, the mouse has escaped! So plan 
accordingly. Now, you can place 1 wall down at a time. ENJOY!



NOTE: The clicking on the hexagons is a little glitchy, if you click outside the
square inside the hexagon, the program might read it as a click on another
hexagon so try clicking in the middle of each hexagon. 

NOTE 2: Currently the mouse is really quite stupid and prefers going up
the board initally always. I hope to change this in the future where 
the mouse looks at the initial placement of the walls and makes a 
smart initial move as well.
